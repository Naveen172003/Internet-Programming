        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>C++ is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. 
            This C++ tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of C++ for beginners to advanded software engineers.</p>

                What is C++ ?
            </h2>
                <p>C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. 
                C++ is a superset of the C language.
                A related programming language, Java, is based on C++ but optimized for the distribution of program objects in a network such as the Internet. 
                Java is somewhat simpler and easier to learn than C++ and has characteristics that give it other advantages over C++. 
                However, both languages require a considerable amount of study</p>
