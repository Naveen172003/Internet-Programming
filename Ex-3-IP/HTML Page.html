        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Welcome to day two of your web development beginner’s course. Today is the day of HTML! HTML is all about structuring the data. It doesn’t concern itself with how something looks; that’s what CSS is for, which we’ll study tomorrow.

            Just like a building is only as strong as its foundation, HTML is the skeleton that holds everything together. To put it in a more web-based context, HTML makes sure the page is usable on a variety of devices and browsers and provides a structure for adding CSS, JavaScript, and the content of the website or application itself.</p>
        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p> HyperText stands for Link between web pages.
            Markup Language means Text between tags that define the structure.
            HTML is a markup language that is used to create web pages. It defines how the web page looks and how to display content with the help of elements. 
            It forms or defines the structure of our Web Page, thus it forms or defines the structure of our Web Page. We must remember to save your file with .html extension. 
            In this HTML Tutorial, we’ll understand all the basic concepts required to kick-start your journey in HTML</p>
